# Changelog

All notable changes to a-stack are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and a-stack uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

The release workflow uses the section of a version as the notes of its GitHub release. Add a section before you push a version tag.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Each release includes the systemd user unit `a-stack.service`, and `SHA256SUMS` lists it.
- The release notes come from this file.
- docs/install.md has an Update section.

### Changed

- The install script says whether it installed, updated or reinstalled a-stack, with the old and the new version. After an update, it tells you how to restart the service.
- The install script stops with an error if the installed binary does not run.
- docs/install.md downloads the systemd unit from the release instead of the `main` branch.

### Fixed

- Browser view: each group of lines gets its own track in wrapped rows.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-24

The database schema does not change (schema version 5).

### Added

- A systemd user unit, `contrib/systemd/a-stack.service`, that starts a-stack automatically and restarts it after a crash. docs/install.md explains how to set it up.
- The MIT license.
- A demo GIF, screenshots and badges in the README.

### Changed

- Browser view: groups of Tasks that do not depend on each other are shown side by side, and tall columns wrap.
- Browser view: Fit fits the Task cards and centers them.
- Getting started is now a list of short, numbered steps.

### Fixed

- Browser view: lines in wrapped columns stay apart, and groups are clearly separate.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-24

The first release.

### Added

- Workspaces, Sessions and Agents, with one Orchestrator per Session.
- Tasks and the Task graph: assign Tasks, report progress, ask the Operator questions and add dependencies.
- Task mail with mentions.
- A read-only browser view for the Operator.
- Optional mention notices for Agents that run in Herdr.
- One static Linux binary for `amd64` and `arm64`, with SQLite built in. It accepts connections only on `127.0.0.1`.
- An install script that checks the download against the release checksums.
